Welcome to this comprehensive C programming tutorial! Whether you're a complete beginner or looking to deepen your understanding of C, this guide will take you through the fundamentals and introduce advanced concepts as you progress.

## Introduction to C

C is a powerful general-purpose programming language that is widely used in system programming, embedded systems, and applications requiring high performance. It is known for its efficiency, close-to-hardware control, and portability, making it a crucial language in the software industry.

### Why Learn C?

- **Foundation for Other Languages**: C provides the building blocks for many modern languages, such as C++, Java, and Python.
- **Performance**: C is highly efficient and is used in performance-critical applications.
- **Low-level Control**: C allows you to work closely with memory and hardware, providing more control over system resources.

## Setting Up C

To get started with C programming, you'll need to set up a development environment. Here are the steps:

1. **Install a C Compiler**: You can use GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) for Linux/macOS or MinGW for Windows. Both are free and widely used.
2. **Choose an IDE/Text Editor**: Popular options include Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, or Eclipse. Alternatively, you can use a simple text editor like Sublime Text.
3. **Verify Installation**: Once the compiler is installed, verify it by typing `gcc --version` in the terminal or command prompt.

## C Basics

Now that your environment is set up, let’s start with the basics. In this section, we'll cover:

- **Variables and Data Types**: Learn how to declare and use variables in C.
- **Control Structures**: Understand how to use conditional statements and loops.
- **Functions**: Learn how to write reusable code blocks.

### Variables and Data Types

```c showLineNumbers {1-3} /printf/
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int age = 25;
    float height = 5.9;
    char initial = 'A';

    printf("Age: %d, Height: %.1f, Initial: %c\n", age, height, initial);
    return 0;
}
```

### Control Structures

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int age = 20;

    if (age >= 18) {
        printf("You are an adult.\n");
    } else {
        printf("You are a minor.\n");
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("Count: %d\n", i);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Functions

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void greet(char name[]) {
    printf("Hello, %s!\n", name);
}

int main() {
    greet("Alice");
    return 0;
}
```

## Intermediate C

Once you are familiar with the basics, it's time to explore more advanced features of C:

- **Arrays and Pointers**: Learn how to work with arrays and pointers, which are fundamental in C programming.
- **File I/O**: Understand how to read from and write to files.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Explore memory management using `malloc`, `calloc`, and `free`.

### Arrays and Pointers

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int *ptr = numbers;

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("Number: %d, Address: %p\n", *(ptr + i), (ptr + i));
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### File I/O

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *file = fopen("example.txt", "w");
    if (file == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening file!\n");
        return 1;
    }

    fprintf(file, "Hello, File!\n");
    fclose(file);

    return 0;
}
```

### Dynamic Memory Allocation

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int *arr;
    int size = 5;

    arr = (int*) malloc(size * sizeof(int));

    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        arr[i] = i + 1;
        printf("Value: %d\n", arr[i]);
    }

    free(arr);

    return 0;
}
```

## Advanced C

Now that you are comfortable with intermediate topics, let’s move on to some advanced C programming concepts:

- **Structures**: Learn how to group different data types together.
- **Pointers to Functions**: Explore how to use pointers with functions for flexibility.
- **Memory Management**: Delve deeper into memory management and optimization.

### Structures

```c
#include <stdio.h>

struct Student {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float grade;
};

int main() {
    struct Student s1 = {"Alice", 20, 85.5};

    printf("Name: %s, Age: %d, Grade: %.2f\n", s1.name, s1.age, s1.grade);
    return 0;
}
```

### Pointers to Functions

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void add(int a, int b) {
    printf("Sum: %d\n", a + b);
}

int main() {
    void (*func_ptr)(int, int) = &add;
    func_ptr(10, 20);

    return 0;
}
```

### Memory Management

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int *arr;
    int size = 10;

    arr = (int*) malloc(size * sizeof(int));

    if (arr == NULL) {
        printf("Memory not allocated.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        arr[i] = i * 2;
        printf("Value: %d\n", arr[i]);
    }

    free(arr);

    return 0;
}
```
