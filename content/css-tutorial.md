# CSS Tutorial: A Comprehensive Guide

Welcome to this comprehensive CSS tutorial! This guide will help you master the art of styling websites using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Whether you're a beginner or looking to expand your knowledge, this tutorial covers everything from basic styles to advanced layout techniques and animations.

## Introduction to CSS

CSS is the language used to style HTML content, enabling you to control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual presentation of a website.

### Why Learn CSS?

- **Styling and Layout**: CSS allows you to transform plain HTML into visually appealing web pages.
- **Responsiveness**: With CSS, you can create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Customizability**: CSS provides the flexibility to fine-tune every aspect of your site's appearance.

## Setting Up CSS

To use CSS, you can either include it directly in your HTML file (inline or internal) or as an external stylesheet. Here’s how to set up CSS:

### Inline CSS

```html
<p style="color: blue;">This is a blue paragraph.</p>
```

### Internal CSS

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      p {
        color: blue;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is a blue paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### External CSS

Create a separate CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`) and link it to your HTML file.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
```

In `styles.css`:

```css
p {
  color: blue;
}
```

## CSS Basics

Now, let’s dive into the basics of CSS, including selectors, properties, and how to apply styles to HTML elements.

### Selectors

Selectors are used to target HTML elements and apply styles. Some common selectors include:

- **Element Selector**: Targets all instances of an element (e.g., `p` for paragraphs).
- **Class Selector**: Targets elements with a specific class (e.g., `.example`).
- **ID Selector**: Targets an element with a specific ID (e.g., `#header`).

```css
/* Element selector */
p {
  color: green;
}

/* Class selector */
.example {
  font-size: 20px;
}

/* ID selector */
#header {
  background-color: lightgray;
}
```

### Colors and Backgrounds

CSS allows you to set text colors, background colors, and images.

```css
/* Text color */
h1 {
  color: darkblue;
}

/* Background color */
body {
  background-color: lightyellow;
}

/* Background image */
div {
  background-image: url("background.jpg");
}
```

### Fonts and Text Styling

Control the typography of your website using fonts, text alignment, and decoration properties.

```css
h1 {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 32px;
  text-align: center;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

## Intermediate CSS

After mastering the basics, you can start exploring more intermediate CSS concepts such as box model, positioning, and layout techniques.

### Box Model

The box model is fundamental to understanding how elements are sized and spaced in CSS. It consists of four components: content, padding, border, and margin.

```css
div {
  width: 200px;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  margin: 20px;
}
```

### Positioning

CSS provides several ways to position elements on a page:

- **Static**: The default position (elements appear in the normal document flow).
- **Relative**: Positioned relative to its normal position.
- **Absolute**: Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
- **Fixed**: Positioned relative to the viewport.
- **Sticky**: A hybrid between relative and fixed positioning.

```css
div {
  position: relative;
  top: 10px;
  left: 20px;
}
```

### Flexbox

Flexbox is a powerful layout model that allows you to create flexible and responsive layouts.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}

.item {
  flex: 1;
  margin: 10px;
}
```

### Grid

CSS Grid Layout provides a two-dimensional layout system, making it easy to design complex web layouts.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 20px;
}

.item {
  background-color: lightblue;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

## Advanced CSS

Now that you’re comfortable with intermediate concepts, it’s time to explore advanced topics like CSS animations, transitions, and responsive design.

### CSS Animations

CSS animations allow you to animate transitions between different styles.

```css
@keyframes fadeIn {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

div {
  animation: fadeIn 2s ease-in-out;
}
```

### CSS Transitions

Transitions allow you to smoothly change property values over a specified duration.

```css
button {
  background-color: blue;
  transition: background-color 0.5s ease;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: green;
}
```

### Media Queries

Media queries enable responsive design by applying different styles based on the device's characteristics (e.g., screen width).

```css
/* For screens wider than 600px */
@media (min-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightgreen;
  }
}

/* For screens narrower than 600px */
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightpink;
  }
}
```
